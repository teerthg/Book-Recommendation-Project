##  Features

- Takes **User ID** as input
- Recommends top N books not yet read by the user
- Uses **Cosine Similarity** to find similar users
- Clean and interactive UI with **Streamlit**
- Deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**

##  Recommendation Logic

1. Generate a **User-Item Matrix** from ratings.
2. Compute **Cosine Similarity** between users.
3. For a given User ID:
   - Identify top similar users.
   - Aggregate books those users rated.
   - Filter out books already rated by the current user.
   - Recommend top N books based on average ratings.
